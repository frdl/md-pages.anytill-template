# {% site.title %}

*{% package.vendor %}/{% package.shortname %}*

<component src="module:@webfan/md-pages" container-inject="['site', 'app']">
 Although this template repository is addressed to ANY static site builder,
  
 it has a **Circuit Break** HERE:
  
 This *Component* is specific to the [Webfan Webfat](https://github.com/frdlweb/webfat) Builder Components Engine.
 As this is jus a minimalistic example dont worry about this fallback, you can
  * apply this template to your appropriate deployment overwrite
  * Just forget about this issue by using your Target-Engine via [Webfan Webfat as Acclimater/Preprocessor](?tags=#Acclimater)
  
  # Fallback:
  {% site.description %}
  
</component>
